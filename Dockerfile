# Runtime-only image: expects the Spring Boot fat JAR to be built beforehand with
#   ./mvnw -DskipTests clean package
# Building the JAR on the host (instead of inside the container) avoids running Maven
# under QEMU emulation, which fails on Apple Silicon when producing linux/amd64 images.
#
# Build for the target platform, e.g.:
#   docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t seat-service:latest .
#
# The JAR is pure Java bytecode (architecture-independent); only the JRE base image
# is architecture-specific, and it is selected automatically by --platform.
